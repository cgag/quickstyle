Quickstyle.js is a simple tool for quickly experimenting with color combinations on your website using a color picker.

Drop `quickstyle.min.js` this script onto your page and start styling your background and font colors:

`<script src="quickstyle.min.js"></script>`

Demo here: http://curtis.io/quickstyle-demo.html

The color picker is powered by [jscolor](http://jscolor.com/), modified a bit to be distributable as a single script with no image assets.
